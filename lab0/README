The file lab0.c contains the source code for the program.
The program first retrieves the included options using getopt and set the neccessary flags and values for each option.
To understand the getopt API, I used the GNU website's sample code at https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Getopt-Long-Option-Example.html.
I also used the included fd_juggling.html to understand how to change the stdout and stdin to different files.
After retriving the options, if the flag for catch was set to 1, the system used signal to register SIGSEGV to the previously declared handler function
If the flag for segfault was set, a char pointer was set to NULL and then the program would attempt to write a string to it, which calls a segmentation fault.
To read from stdout, a one char buffer was used to read each byte until read returns 0, which meant end of file. 
After each iteration of reading a character, the program would write out to stdout each time.
Finally, the program would deallocate its memory and close stdout and stdin.
backtrace.png is a screenshot of the gdb output and stack backtrace when lab0 is run with --segfault
To achieve this, the program was first compiled with -g. After opening it in gdb and running it, I then used the command backtrace to retrieve the stack information.
breakpoint.png is the screenshot after setting a breakpoint at the line with a segmentation fault and using print to check if the pointer value was NULL. 
For my smoke test, I first tested my program by testing if it returned the right value for a correct input by command line and through a file
Then I tested if it returned the right value for an invalid option
Second, I tested if it returned the right value with a valid output file and an invalid output file
Finally, I tested if catch caught a segmentation fault or not.
At the very end of the output will be the string "All tests successful"
