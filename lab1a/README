lab1a.c:
The C source file following the specs of the project
I used my previous project as an example to write the getopt segment.
I used the manual pages to learn how to use the mentioned syscalls like pipe, kill, and poll
Some of the errors I encountered were figuring out to set up the two pipes for the parent and the child proccess
I used an example from tutorialspoint, which i found in their unix tutorials, to better understand how to use piping
I also had problem debugging, as I used fprintf() to debug the multiple proccesses. 
Makefile:
A Makefile with three options: default, clean, and dist
The default silently compiles lab1a.c with the options -w -Wall -Wextra into an executable names lab1a
The clean removes lab1a and the tarball in the working directory
The dist option creates a tarball from the C source file, the Makefile, and the README file.
README:
A text file that describes the file within the tarball.
It includes the proccess of coding the program and any other miscillaneous information.
