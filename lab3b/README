lab3b.py:
A python script that analyzes an included csv file.
The script first takes the data from the file using the csv module and shoves it into data structures reflecting each category of entry
The script then performs its anaylsis by reading the three areas specified in the lab3
The block anaylztion proved to be the most difficult due to the diffulcty I had reading the individual blocks.
Some bugs I encountered in that section was handling 0 blocks and reading the indirect blocks incorrectly by using the wrong arguments
The inode section proved the easiest to understand for me
The directory section was also diffulcty due to the amount of cases that I needed to handle.
Makefile: A Makefile with the three targets specified. 
The default option copies the python script into one called lab3b and changes the permissions so it is executable
The clean option removes the lab3b file and tarball
The make option creates a tarball
README:
A file that describes the included files and specific details about the program like testing and development.
